Brian; Roberts, William W.; Schade, George R.; Xu, Zhen; Khokhlova, Tatiana D.; Hall, Timothy L.; Maxwell, Adam D.; Wang, Yak Nam; Cain, Charles A.",Histotripsy methods in mechanical disintegration of tissue: Towards clinical applications,,,,,"© 2015 Informa UK Ltd. All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted. In high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy, an ultrasound beam is focused within the body to locally affect the targeted site without damaging intervening tissues. The most common HIFU regime is thermal ablation. Recently there has been increasing interest in generating purely mechanical lesions in tissue (histotripsy). This paper provides an overview of several studies on the development of histotripsy methods toward clinical applications. Two histotripsy approaches and examples of their applications are presented. In one approach, sequences of high-amplitude, short (microsecond-long), focused ultrasound pulses periodically produce dense, energetic bubble clouds that mechanically disintegrate tissue. In an alternative approach, longer (millisecond-long) pulses with shock fronts generate boiling bubbles and the interaction of shock fronts with the resulting vapour cavity causes tissue disintegration. Recent preclinical studies on histotripsy are reviewed for treating benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), liver and kidney tumours, kidney stone fragmentation, enhancing anti-tumour immune response, and tissue decellularisation for regenerative medicine applications. Potential clinical advantages of the histotripsy methods are discussed. Histotripsy methods can be used to mechanically ablate a wide variety of tissues, whilst selectivity sparing structures such as large vessels. Both ultrasound and MR imaging can be used for targeting and monitoring the treatment in real time. Although the two approaches utilise different mechanisms for tissue disintegration, both have many of the same advantages and offer a promising alternative method of non-invasive surgery.",2015,2021-06-09 17:06:01,2022-08-19 19:13:57,,,,,,,,,,ISSN: 14645157 Publication Title: International Journal of Hyperthermia DOI: 10.3109/02656736.2015.1007538,,Review; Ultrasound; High intensity focused ultrasound; Physics,High Intensity Focused Ultrasound,,

Here, we investigated the role of focused ultrasound based boiling histotripsy (HT)  and in-situ anti-CD40 agonist antibody (αCD40) combinatorial therapy in enhancing  therapeutic efficacy against ICI refractory murine melanoma. Methods: Unilateral and  bilateral large (~330-400 mm(3)) poorly immunogenic B16F10 melanoma tumors were  established in the flank regions of mice.

The ability of HT40 ± ICI to enhance local and systemic effects was  determined by immunological characterization of the harvested tissues, and by tumor  growth delay of local and distant untreated tumors 4-6 weeks post treatment.  Results: Immune profiling revealed that HT40 upregulated a variety of inflammatory  markers in the tumors. Immunologically, HT40 treated tumors showed an increased  population of granzyme B+ expressing functional CD8+ T cells (~4-fold) as well as an  increased M1 to M2 macrophage ratio (~2-3-fold) and CD8+ T: regulatory T cell ratio  (~5-fold) compared to the untreated control.

The magnitude of this immunostimulation was stronger than that seen with tumor irradiation or thermal ablation. Histotripsy also promoted abscopal immune responses at untreated tumor sites and inhibited growth of pulmonary metastases. Histotripsy was capable of releasing tumor antigens with retained immunogenicity, and this immunostimulatory effect was associated with calreticulin translocation to the cellular membrane and local and systemic release of high mobility group box protein 1. Histotripsy ablation potentiated the efficacy of checkpoint inhibition immunotherapy in murine models of melanoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: These preclinical observations suggest that non-invasive histotripsy ablation can be used to stimulate tumor-specific immune responses capable of magnifying the impact of checkpoint inhibition immunotherapy.",2020-01,2022-08-17 14:54:58,2022-08-18 23:55:16,,e000200,1,8,,,eng,,,Number: 1 PMID: 31940590,,Primary; PreClinical; ResearchArticle; IHC; Histology; Histotripsy; HepatocellularCarcinoma; Heterotopic; melanoma; Flank; FlowCytometry; FUS-alone; H&E; PrimaryTumor; FUS-Drug; Orthotopic; Skin; aCTLA-4; anti-CTLA-4; B16GP33; CD8+ T cell stimulation; HCC; Hepa1-6; liver,FUS-alone,"Carcinoma, Melanoma",Melanoma

However, compared to surgery alone, M-HIFU combined with surgery were found to significantly inhibit the growth of rechallenged tumors, down-regulate intra-tumoral STAT3 activities, increase cytotoxic T cells in spleens and tumor draining lymph nodes (TDLNs), and improve the host survival. Furthermore, M-HIFU combined with surgery was found to significantly decrease the level of immunosuppression with concomitantly increased number and activities of dendritic cells, compared to surgery alone.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 12 patients (9 females) whose average age was 56.9 years (37 - 81) were treated with HIFU in an ambulatory setting. All patients had a single benign thyroid nodule treated in one HIFU session. The median nodular outline volume (NOV) was 3.4 ml (range 0.6 - 5.0 ml). The therapeutic ultrasound probe (Echopulse((R)) THC900 888-H) used works with a frequency of 3 MHz, reaching temperatures of 80 - 90 degrees C and a mean output between 87.6 and 192.8 W. To assess possible effects of HIFU on thyroid function, serum levels of triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), thyrotropin (TSH), thyroglobulin (hTg) and antibodies against thyroglobulin (TAbs), thyrotropin receptors (TRAbs) and thyroid peroxidase (TPOAbs) were measured at enrollment, 24-hours post-HIFU treatment and at 3-month follow-up.Pre- post thyroglobulin reduction was measured to evaluate the success of ablation and the nodular outline volume (NOV) was evaluated at baseline and the 3-month follow-up to assess effectiveness. RESULTS: All measured hormone levels were within normal ranges and remained stable (p \textgreater 0.05). No clinically meaningful immune reaction was induced (p \textgreater 0.05).

While current clinical strategies employ HIFU exclusively for thermal ablation of the target sites, biological responses associated with both thermal and mechanical damage from focused ultrasound have not been thoroughly investigated. In particular, endogenous danger signals from HIFU-damaged tumor cells may trigger the activation of dendritic cells. This response may play a critical role in a HIFU-elicited anti-tumor immune response which can be harnessed for more effective treatment. METHODS: Mice bearing MC-38 colon adenocarcinoma tumors were treated with thermal and mechanical HIFU exposure settings in order to independently observe HIFU-induced effects on the host's immunological response. In vivo dendritic cell activity was assessed along with the host's response to challenge tumor growth. RESULTS: Thermal and mechanical HIFU were found to increase CD11c+ cells 3.1-fold and 4-fold, respectively, as compared to 1.5-fold observed for DC injection alone. In addition, thermal and mechanical HIFU increased CFSE+ DC accumulation in draining lymph nodes 5-fold and 10-fold, respectively. Moreover, focused ultrasound treatments not only caused a reduction in the growth of primary tumors, with tumor volume decreasing by 85% for thermal HIFU and 43% for mechanical HIFU, but they also provided protection against subcutaneous tumor re-challenge. Further immunological assays confirmed an enhanced CTL activity and increased tumor-specific IFN-gamma-secreting cells in the mice treated by focused ultrasound, with cytotoxicity induced by mechanical HIFU reaching as high as 27% at a 10:1 effector:target ratio. CONCLUSION: These studies present initial encouraging results confirming that focused ultrasound treatment can elicit a systemic anti-tumor immune response, and they suggest that this immunity is closely related to dendritic cell activation.

This response may play a critical role in a HIFU-elicited anti-tumor immune response which can be harnessed for more effective treatment. METHODS: Mice bearing MC-38 colon adenocarcinoma tumors were treated with thermal and mechanical HIFU exposure settings in order to independently observe HIFU-induced effects on the host's immunological response. In vivo dendritic cell activity was assessed along with the host's response to challenge tumor growth. RESULTS: Thermal and mechanical HIFU were found to increase CD11c+ cells 3.1-fold and 4-fold, respectively, as compared to 1.5-fold observed for DC injection alone. In addition, thermal and mechanical HIFU increased CFSE+ DC accumulation in draining lymph nodes 5-fold and 10-fold, respectively. Moreover, focused ultrasound treatments not only caused a reduction in the growth of primary tumors, with tumor volume decreasing by 85% for thermal HIFU and 43% for mechanical HIFU, but they also provided protection against subcutaneous tumor re-challenge. Further immunological assays confirmed an enhanced CTL activity and increased tumor-specific IFN-gamma-secreting cells in the mice treated by focused ultrasound, with cytotoxicity induced by mechanical HIFU reaching as high as 27% at a 10:1 effector:target ratio. CONCLUSION: These studies present initial encouraging results confirming that focused ultrasound treatment can elicit a systemic anti-tumor immune response, and they suggest that this immunity is closely related to dendritic cell activation. Because DC activation was more pronounced when tumor cells were mechanically lysed by focused ultrasound treatment, mechanical HIFU in particular may be employed as a potential strategy in combination with subsequent thermal ablations for increasing the efficacy of HIFU cancer treatment by enhancing the host's anti-tumor immunity.",2007-07,2022-08-17 14:54:58,2022-08-18 23:49:31,,34,,5,,,eng,,,PMID: 17625013,,Primary; ResearchArticle; IHC; Histotripsy; Heterotopic; Mechanical; HIFU; Ultrasonography; Animals; Mice; Female; Temperature; Dendritic Cells; Cell Death; FlowCytometry; FUS-alone; Preclinical; Adenocarcinoma; Animal; Cell Proliferation; Dendritic Cells: immunology; Disease Models; ELISpot; High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation; Hindlimb; Immunity; Immunity: immunology; Inbred C57BL; Lymph Nodes; Lymph Nodes: immunology; Pulsed-FUS; Colon; diagnostic imaging; immunology; Neoplasms; pathology; FUS-ThermalAblation; methods; Cell Movement; ColonAdenocarcinoma; CTL; CytokineAssay; DC; Dendritic Cells: pathology; High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation: method; Lymph Nodes: pathology; MC38; mechanical; Mechanical-FUS; Neoplasms: immunology; Neoplasms: ultrasonography,Mechanical,"Adenocarcinoma, Carcinoma",Carcinoma

The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of local-focused ultrasound (FUS) heating ( approximately 42-45 degrees C) and in-situ anti-CD-40 agonistic antibody in enhancing T-cell function for melanoma immunotherapy. We compared the following groups of mice with bilateral flank B16 F10 melanoma: (1) Control, (2) FUS, (3) CD-40, and (4) CD-40 + FUS (FUS40). FUS heating was applied for approximately 15 min in right flank tumor, and intratumoral injections of CD-40 were performed sequentially within 4 h. A total of 3 FUS and 4 anti-CD-40 treatments were administered unilaterally 3 days apart. Mice were sacrificed 30 days post-inoculation, and the treated tumor and spleen tissues were profiled for T-cell function and macrophage polarization. Compared to all other groups, histology and flow cytometry showed that FUS40 increased the population of tumor-specific CD-4+ and CD-8+ T cells rich in Granzyme B+, interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IFN-gamma production and poor in PD-1 expression. In addition, FUS40 promoted the infiltration of tumor-suppressing M1 phenotype macrophages in the treated mice.

In the present study, we investigated whether HIFU ablation could activate tumor-specific T lymphocytes and then induce antitumor cellular immunity. We studied 70 C57BL/6J mice bearing the H(22) tumor; they were randomly divided into a HIFU group and a sham-HIFU group. Of the mice, 35 in the HIFU group underwent HIFU ablation of the H(22) hepatic tumor, and the remaining 35 received a sham-HIFU procedure. In addition, 35 female, naïve syngeneic C57BL/6J mice were used as controls. All mice were sacrificed 14 days after HIFU, and the spleens were harvested. The function of T lymphocytes was determined. As a valuable tool for detecting and characterizing peptide-specific cells, the frequency of MHC class I tetramer/CD8-positive cells was quantified, which could help to determine the response and number of T lymphocytes. The therapeutic effect of the HIFU-activated lymphocytes on tumor-bearing mice was investigated after adoptive transfer of the lymphocytes. The results showed that compared to sham-HIFU and control groups, HIFU ablation significantly increased the cytotoxicity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (p \textless 0.05), with a significant increase of IFN-γ and TNF-α secretion (p \textless 0.001). The frequency of the MHC class I tetramer/CD8-positive cells was significantly higher in the HIFU group (p \textless 0.05). A stronger inhibition of tumor progression and higher survival rates were observed to be significant after adoptive immunotherapy in the HIFU group as compared to the sham-HIFU and control groups (p \textless 0.01). It is concluded that HIFU ablation could activate tumor-specific T lymphocytes, thus inducing antitumor cellular immune responses in tumor-bearing mice.",2012-08,2021-06-04 19:04:35,2022-08-18 23:45:40,,1363–71,8,38,,,,,,Number: 8 PMID: 22633269,,Primary; Liver; Histology; HIFU; ELISA; H&E; HCC; Pre-clinical; CytokineAssay; Research,High Intensity Focused Ultrasound,,

However, recent clinical studies suggest that inducing tumor damage can render TNBC responsive to immunotherapy. We therefore tested a strategy for immune sensitization of murine TNBC (4T1 tumors) through combination of focused ultrasound (FUS) thermal ablation and a chemotherapy, gemcitabine (GEM), known to attenuate myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). METHODS: We applied a sparse-scan thermally ablative FUS regimen at the tumor site in combination with systemically administered GEM. We used flow cytometry analysis to investigate the roles of monotherapy and combinatorial therapy in mediating local and systemic immunity. We also tested this combination in Rag1(-/-) mice or T cell-depleted wild-type mice to determine the essentiality of adaptive immunity. Further, we layered Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade onto this combination to evaluate its impact on tumor outgrowth and survival. RESULTS: The immune-modulatory effect of FUS monotherapy was insufficient to promote a robust T cell response against 4T1, consistent with the dominant MDSC-driven immunosuppression evident in this model. The combination of FUS+GEM significantly constrained primary TNBC tumor outgrowth and extended overall survival of mice. Tumor control correlated with increased circulating antigen-experienced T cells and was entirely dependent on T cell-mediated immunity. The ability of FUS+GEM to control primary tumor outgrowth was moderately enhanced by either neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with anti-PD-1. CONCLUSION: Thermally ablative FUS in combination with GEM restricts primary tumor outgrowth, improves survival and enhances immunogenicity in a murine metastatic TNBC model.

However, this strategy is not most effective in terms of inducing a systemic anti-tumor immunity so that it cannot provide efficient micro-metastatic control and long-term tumor resistance. We have previously provided evidence that HIFU may enhance systemic anti-tumor immunity by in situ activation of dendritic cells (DCs) inside HIFU-treated tumor tissue. The present study was conducted to test the feasibility of a sparse-scan strategy to boost HIFU-induced anti-tumor immune response by more effectively promoting DC maturation. METHODS: An experimental HIFU system was set up to perform tumor ablation experiments in subcutaneous implanted MC-38 and B16 tumor with dense- or sparse-scan strategy to produce closely-packed or separated thermal lesions. DCs infiltration into HIFU-treated tumor tissues was detected by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. DCs maturation was evaluated by IL-12/IL-10 production and CD80/CD86 expression after co-culture with tumor cells treated with different HIFU. HIFU-induced anti-tumor immune response was evaluated by detecting growth-retarding effects on distant re-challenged tumor and tumor-specific IFN-gamma-secreting cells in HIFU-treated mice. RESULTS: HIFU exposure raised temperature up to 80 degrees centigrade at beam focus within 4 s in experimental tumors and led to formation of a well-defined thermal lesion. The infiltrated DCs were recruited to the periphery of lesion, where the peak temperature was only 55 degrees centigrade during HIFU exposure. Tumor cells heated to 55 degrees centigrade in 4-s HIFU exposure were more effective to stimulate co-cultured DCs to mature. Sparse-scan HIFU, which can reserve 55 degrees-heated tumor cells surrounding the separated lesions, elicited an enhanced anti-tumor immune response than dense-scan HIFU, while their suppressive effects on the treated primary tumor were maintained at the same level. Flow cytometry analysis showed that sparse-scan HIFU was more effective than dense-scan HIFU in enhancing DC infiltration into tumor tissues and promoting their maturation in situ.

We evaluated the feasibility, short-term histologic effects and the resulting acute inflammatory response to BH ablation of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in the Eker rat. Genotyped Eker rats were monitored for de novo RCCs with serial ultrasound (US) imaging. When tumors were \textgreater/=8 mm, rats underwent ultrasound-guided extracorporeal ablation of the tumor with BH, a pulsed focused US technique that produces non-thermal mechanical ablation of targeted tissues, or a sham US procedure. Treatments targeted approximately 50% of the largest RCC with a margin of normal kidney. BH treated rats were euthanized at 1 (n=4) or 48 (n=4) h, and sham patients (n=4) at 48 h. Circulating plasma cytokine levels were assessed with multiplex assays before and at 0.25, 1, 4, 24 and 48 h following treatment. Kidneys were collected and processed for histologic assessment, immunohistochemistry and intrarenal cytokine concentration measurements. For statistical analysis Student's t-test was used. US-guided BH treatment was successful in all animals, producing hypoechoic regions within the targeted volume consistent with BH treatment effect. Grossly, regions of homogenized tissue were apparent with evidence of focal intra-parenchymal hemorrhage. Histologically, BH produced a sharply demarcated region of homogenized tumor and non-tumor tissue containing acellular debris. BH treatment was associated with significantly increased relative concentration of plasma TNF versus sham treatment (p \textless 0.05) and transient elevations in high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), IL-10 and IL-6 consistent with acute inflammatory response to trauma. Intrarenal cytokine concentrations followed the same trend. At 48 h, enhanced infiltration of CD8(+) T cells was observed by immunohistochemistry in both the treated and un-treated contralateral RCC/kidneys in BH-treated animals versus sham treatment. BH treatment was well tolerated with transient gross hematuria and a perinephric hematoma developing in one subject each.

We evaluated the feasibility, short-term histologic effects and the resulting acute inflammatory response to BH ablation of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in the Eker rat. Genotyped Eker rats were monitored for de novo RCCs with serial ultrasound (US) imaging. When tumors were \textgreater/=8 mm, rats underwent ultrasound-guided extracorporeal ablation of the tumor with BH, a pulsed focused US technique that produces non-thermal mechanical ablation of targeted tissues, or a sham US procedure. Treatments targeted approximately 50% of the largest RCC with a margin of normal kidney. BH treated rats were euthanized at 1 (n=4) or 48 (n=4) h, and sham patients (n=4) at 48 h. Circulating plasma cytokine levels were assessed with multiplex assays before and at 0.25, 1, 4, 24 and 48 h following treatment. Kidneys were collected and processed for histologic assessment, immunohistochemistry and intrarenal cytokine concentration measurements. For statistical analysis Student's t-test was used. US-guided BH treatment was successful in all animals, producing hypoechoic regions within the targeted volume consistent with BH treatment effect. Grossly, regions of homogenized tissue were apparent with evidence of focal intra-parenchymal hemorrhage. Histologically, BH produced a sharply demarcated region of homogenized tumor and non-tumor tissue containing acellular debris. BH treatment was associated with significantly increased relative concentration of plasma TNF versus sham treatment (p \textless 0.05) and transient elevations in high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), IL-10 and IL-6 consistent with acute inflammatory response to trauma. Intrarenal cytokine concentrations followed the same trend. At 48 h, enhanced infiltration of CD8(+) T cells was observed by immunohistochemistry in both the treated and un-treated contralateral RCC/kidneys in BH-treated animals versus sham treatment. BH treatment was well tolerated with transient gross hematuria and a perinephric hematoma developing in one subject each. The study demonstrates the feasibility of BH ablation of de novo RCC and suggests activation of the acute inflammatory cascade following treatment that appears to stimulate CD8+ T cell infiltration of both treated and untreated tumors.

While promising preclinical work has paved the way for the initiation of 3 human trials, there remains concern regarding neuroinflammation following treatment. The aim of this study was to assess the magnitude of this response following sonication and explore the influence of MB dose. Methods: Differential expression of NFκB signaling pathway genes was assessed in rats at 6 h and 4 days following a FUS-mediated increase in BBB permeability. Three sonication schemes were tested: (1) a clinical imaging dose of MBs + peak negative pressure (PNP) controlled by acoustic feedback, (2) 10x clinical imaging dose of MBs + constant PNP of 0.290 MPa, and (3) 10x clinical imaging dose of MBs + PNP controlled by acoustic feedback. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to assess edema and hemorrhage. Hematoxylin and eosin histology was used to evaluate general tissue health. Results: MB dose has a significant impact on the expression of several key genes involved in acute inflammation and immune activation, including Tnf, Birc3, and Ccl2. At a clinical imaging dose of MBs, there were no significant changes detected in the expression of any NFκB signaling pathway genes. Conversely, a high MB dose resulted in a clear activation of the NFκB signaling pathway, accompanied by edema, neuronal degeneration, neutrophil infiltration, and microhemorrhage. Results also suggest that post-FUS gadolinium enhancement may hold predictive value in assessing the magnitude of inflammatory response. Conclusion: While a significant and damaging inflammatory response was observed at high MB doses, it was demonstrated that FUS can be used to induce increased BBB permeability without an associated upregulation of NFκB signaling pathway gene expression.

The results showed that both HIFU-ablated tumour and tumour lysate could significantly increase the number of mature DCs and the secretion of IL-12 and IFN-gamma (p\textless0.001). The proliferation of splenic lymphocytes co-incubated with the loaded-DCs was significantly higher in both HIFU-ablated tumour and tumour lysate groups (p\textless0.01). Cytotoxocity and TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma secretion of cytotoxic T lymphocytes against H22 cells were significantly higher in HIFU-ablated tumour group than that in tumour lysate group (p\textless0.01). After the H22 tumour challenge, a significant decrease of tumour volume was observed in HIFU-ablated tumour group (p\textless0.01). However, there was no statistical difference of long-term survival rates among three groups (p\textgreater0.05). It is concluded that DCs can be activated by HIFU-ablated tumour debris and, thus, initiate host specific antitumour immune response after HIFU therapy.",2010-03,2022-08-17 14:54:58,2022-08-17 20:44:48,,441–8,3,36,,,,,,Number: 3 PMID: 20172447,,Primary; ResearchArticle; Liver; HepatocellularCarcinoma; Metastases; Heterotopic; Humans; HIFU; Animals; Cell Line; Mice; Dendritic Cells; Ultrasonics; Flank; FlowCytometry; FUS-alone; HCC; Cell Proliferation; Dendritic Cells: immunology; Inbred C57BL; Spleen; Tumor; Pre-clinical; FUS-ThermalAblation; DC; Dendritic Cells: pathology; Antigens; Lymphocytes; Cancer Vaccines; Cancer Vaccines: immunology; Cancer Vaccines: pharmacology; Carcinoma; Cell Proliferation: drug effects; H22; Hepatocellular; Hepatocellular: immunology; Hepatocellular: therapy; Liver Neoplasms; Liver Neoplasms: immunology; Liver Neoplasms: therapy; Lymphocytes: cytology; Lymphocytes: drug effects; M; MTT; Neoplasm; Neoplasm: immunology; Neoplasm: pharmacology; Spleen: cytology,Thermal Ablation,Carcinoma,Carcinoma

NK-92, a human NK cell line, may be targeted to tumor-associated antigens in solid malignancies where it exhibits antitumor efficacy, but its clinical utility for treating brain tumors is limited by an inability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We investigated the potential for focused ultrasound (FUS) to deliver targeted NK-92 cells to the brain using a model of metastatic breast cancer. HER2-expressing human breast tumor cells were implanted into the brain of nude rats. The NK-92-scFv(FRP5)-zeta cell line expressing a chimeric HER2 antigen receptor was transfected with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles before intravenous injection, before and following BBB disruption using focused ultrasound (551.5 kHz focused transducer, 0.33 MPa average peak rarefaction pressure) in the presence of a microbubble contrast agent. Baseline and posttreatment 1.5T and 7T MR imaging was done, and histology used to identify NK-92 cells post-mortem.

NK-92, a human NK cell line, may be targeted to tumor-associated antigens in solid malignancies where it exhibits antitumor efficacy, but its clinical utility for treating brain tumors is limited by an inability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We investigated the potential for focused ultrasound (FUS) to deliver targeted NK-92 cells to the brain using a model of metastatic breast cancer. HER2-expressing human breast tumor cells were implanted into the brain of nude rats. The NK-92-scFv(FRP5)-zeta cell line expressing a chimeric HER2 antigen receptor was transfected with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles before intravenous injection, before and following BBB disruption using focused ultrasound (551.5 kHz focused transducer, 0.33 MPa average peak rarefaction pressure) in the presence of a microbubble contrast agent. Baseline and posttreatment 1.5T and 7T MR imaging was done, and histology used to identify NK-92 cells post-mortem.

Novel treatment modalities able to release cancer-specific antigens, render immunologically “cold” pancreatic tumours “hot” and disrupt or reprogram the pancreatic tumour microenvironment are thus urgently needed. Therapeutic focused ultrasound exerts thermal and mechanical effects on tissue, killing cancer cells and inducing an anti-cancer immune response. The most important advances in therapeutic focused ultrasound use for initiation and augmentation of the cancer immunity cycle against pancreatic cancer are described. We provide a comprehensive review of the use of therapeutic focused ultrasound for the treatment of pancreatic cancer patients and describe recent studies that have shown an ultrasound-induced anti-cancer immune response in several tumour models. Published studies that have investigated the immunological effects of therapeutic focused ultrasound in pancreatic cancer are described. This article shows that therapeutic focused ultrasound has been deemed to be a safe technique for treating pancreatic cancer patients, providing pain relief and improving survival rates in pancreatic cancer patients. Promotion of an immune response in the clinic and sensitisation of tumours to the effects of immunotherapy in preclinical models of pancreatic cancer is shown, making it a promising candidate for use in the clinic.",2022-01-27,2022-08-17 19:00:29,2022-08-17 19:00:37,2022-08-17 19:00:29,638,3,14,Cancers,,en,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,Review,,,

One of the most debilitating aspects of cancer is the burden brought on by metastatic disease. Therefore, an ideal treatment protocol would address not only debulking larger primary tumors but also circulating tumor cells and distant metastases. To address this need, the use of immune modulating therapies has become a pillar in the oncology armamentarium. A therapeutic option that has recently emerged is the use of focal ablation therapies that can destroy a tumor through various physical or mechanical mechanisms and release a cellular lysate with the potential to stimulate an immune response. Histotripsy is a non-invasive, non-ionizing, non-thermal, ultrasound guided ablation technology that has shown promise over the past decade as a debulking therapy. As histotripsy therapies have developed, the full picture of the accompanying immune response has revealed a wide range of immunogenic mechanisms that include DAMP and anti-tumor mediator release, changes in local cellular immune populations, development of a systemic immune response, and therapeutic synergism with the inclusion of checkpoint inhibitor therapies. These studies also suggest that there is an immune effect from histotripsy therapies across multiple murine tumor types that may be reproducible. Overall, the effects of histotripsy on tumors show a positive effect on immunomodulation.",2021-05-31,2022-08-17 18:40:01,2022-08-17 18:40:08,2022-08-17 18:40:01,681629,,11,Front.

Our results showed that GC decreased the expression of Twist-1 and Slug, proto-oncogenes commonly implicated in metastasis. Epithelial-cadherin, which is regulated by these genes, was also upregulated. Taken together, our current data suggest that GC alone can reduce cancer cell motility and invasion, whereas GC-HIFU treatment can induce immune responses to suppress tumor metastasis in vivo.",2014-04,2022-08-17 14:54:58,2022-08-17 14:54:58,,e1178,4,5,,,,,,Number: 4 PMID: 24743733,,ResearchArticle; Metastases; Heterotopic; HIFU; ELISA; H&E; Preclinical; PrimaryTumor; WesternBlot; FUS-Drug; Pulsed-FUS; MB; 4T1; Breast; GlycatedChitosan; immunoadjuvant; Lung,Pulsed Focused Ultrasound,Breast Cancer,Breast Cancer

Since focused ultrasound (FUS) has been confirmed to temporally and locally open the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the purpose of this study was to elucidate the possibility of combining FUS-induced BBB opening with IL-12 delivery to enhance the anticancer immunological response for glioma treatment. METHODS: FUS energy combined with microbubble administration was delivered transcranially to open BBB, and C-6 glioma rats were used in this study. The efficacy in inducing BBB opening and the corresponding immunological response were primarily evaluated in normal animals. The anticancer immune-triggering chemokine, IL-12, was intraperitoneally administered during the treatment phase to evaluate the effect of immunological response on tumor progression. Glioma animals were sub-grouped to evaluate the effect of the immune response in suppressing glioma when IL-12 was combined with FUS-induced BBB opening. We performed flow cytometry to verify consequent immune cell population changes of peripheral/ tissue lymphocytes as well as macrophages from the animals. Brain sections of sacrificed animals were also used for histological and immunohistochemical analysis. IL-12 level among experimental groups were measured via ELISA analysis. We also analyzed survival and followed tumor progression in vivo via T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: FUS-induced BBB opening had no obvious effect on the T lymphocytes population in normal animals, either in the brain or systemically. Yet, it triggered mild changes in the tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) population, particularly in numbers of CD3 + CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in the tumor region. IL-12 administration triggered a profound increase in all TIL populations, including CD3 + CD4+ T helper cells (Th), CTL, and CD4 + CD25+ regulatory T cells (Treg), but combined FUS-BBB opening with IL-12 administration produced the most significant IL-12 increase, CTL increase and CTL/Treg ratio increase, thus contributing to the most significant suppression of tumor progression and increased animal survival. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that FUS-BBB opening can enhance immune-modulating agent delivery to the brain, which improve the anticancer immune response in brain tumor treatment.",2015-01,2022-08-17 14:54:58,2022-08-17 14:54:58,,451,,13,,,,,,PMID: 25784614,,Primary; Review; immunotherapy; ELISA; FlowCytometry; H&E; Pre-clinical; Brain; GBM; FUS-BBBo; contrast; IL12; Microarray,Blood-Brain Barrier Opening,GBM,GBM

Current evidence has found good short- to medium-term outcomes, similar to those of better-established ablation techniques such as radiofrequency and laser ablation. The fact that it does not require insertion of a needle into the target makes HIFU a truly non-invasive treatment. Although it is not without risks, its low risk profile makes it an attractive alternative to surgery. There is much room for future development, starting from expanding the current indications to enhancing energy delivery. Relapsed Graves disease and papillary microcarcinoma are diseases that can benefit from HIFU treatment. Its role in the mediation of immune responses and synergistic effects with immunotherapy are promising in the fight against metastatic cancers.",2019-04,2022-08-17 14:54:58,2022-08-17 14:54:58,,135–142,2,38,,,eng,,,Number: 2 PMID: 30690961,,Review; ClinicalTrial; FUS-ThermalAblation; Thyroid; ThyroidNodule,Thermal Ablation,,

High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has the potential to be such a treatment, as it can non-invasively ablate a targeted tumour below the skin surface, and may subsequently augment host antitumour immunity. In addition to thermal and cavitation effects, which act directly and locally on the tumour, there is increasing evidence linking systemic anti-tumour immune response to HIFU ablation. This may provide micro-metastatic control and long-term tumour resistance for cancer patients. The goal of this article is to review the emerging pre-clinical and clinical results suggesting that HIFU ablation may enhance host anti-tumour immunity, and to discuss its potential mechanisms.

The in situ destruction of solid tumours by such therapies is thought to release antigens that can prime an antitumour immune response. In this review, we offer an overview of the current evidence for immune response activation associated with the utilisation of the main thermal and non-thermal ablation therapies currently in use today. This is followed by an assessment of the hypothesised mechanisms behind this immune response priming and by a discussion of potential methods of harnessing this specific response, which may subsequently be applicable in the treatment of cancer patients. References were identified through searches of PubMed/MEDLINE and Cochrane databases to identify peer-reviewed original articles, meta-analyses and reviews. Papers were searched from 1850 until October 2014. Articles were also identified through searches of the authors' files. Only papers published in English were reviewed. Thermal and non-thermal therapies have the potential to stimulate antitumour immunity although the current body of evidence is based mostly on murine trials or small-scale phase 1 human trials. The evidence for this immune-modulatory response is currently the strongest in relation to cryotherapy and radiotherapy, although data is accumulating for related ablative treatments such as high-intensity focused ultrasound, radiofrequency ablation and irreversible electroporation. This effect may be greatly enhanced by combining these therapies with other immunostimulatory interventions. Evidence is emerging into the immunomodulatory effect associated with thermal and non-thermal ablative therapies used in cancer treatment in addition to the mechanism behind this effect and how it may be harnessed for therapeutic use. A potential exists for treatment approaches that combine ablation of the primary tumour with control and possible eradication of persistent, locally recurrent and metastatic disease. However, more work is needed into each of these modalities, initially in further animal studies and then subsequently in large-scale prospective human studies.",2015-12,2022-08-17 14:54:58,2022-08-17 14:54:58,,9137–9146,12,36,,,eng,,,Number: 12 PMID: 26423402,,Review; Humans; High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation; Immunity; immunology; Neoplasms; pathology; therapy; Immunomodulation; Active; Catheter Ablation; Cryotherapy; Photochemotherapy; PubMed,High Intensity Focused Ultrasound,,

In this review, we offer an overview of the current evidence for immune response activation associated with the utilisation of the main thermal and non-thermal ablation therapies currently in use today. This is followed by an assessment of the hypothesised mechanisms behind this immune response priming and by a discussion of potential methods of harnessing this specific response, which may subsequently be applicable in the treatment of cancer patients. References were identified through searches of PubMed/MEDLINE and Cochrane databases to identify peer-reviewed original articles, meta-analyses and reviews. Papers were searched from 1850 until October 2014. Articles were also identified through searches of the authors' files. Only papers published in English were reviewed. Thermal and non-thermal therapies have the potential to stimulate antitumour immunity although the current body of evidence is based mostly on murine trials or small-scale phase 1 human trials. The evidence for this immune-modulatory response is currently the strongest in relation to cryotherapy and radiotherapy, although data is accumulating for related ablative treatments such as high-intensity focused ultrasound, radiofrequency ablation and irreversible electroporation. This effect may be greatly enhanced by combining these therapies with other immunostimulatory interventions. Evidence is emerging into the immunomodulatory effect associated with thermal and non-thermal ablative therapies used in cancer treatment in addition to the mechanism behind this effect and how it may be harnessed for therapeutic use. A potential exists for treatment approaches that combine ablation of the primary tumour with control and possible eradication of persistent, locally recurrent and metastatic disease. However, more work is needed into each of these modalities, initially in further animal studies and then subsequently in large-scale prospective human studies.",2015-12,2022-08-17 14:54:58,2022-08-17 14:54:58,,9137–9146,12,36,,,eng,,,Number: 12 PMID: 26423402,,Review; Humans; High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation; Immunity; immunology; Neoplasms; pathology; therapy; Immunomodulation; Active; Catheter Ablation; Cryotherapy; Photochemotherapy; PubMed,Thermal Ablation,,

Different from the traditional direct killing or excision therapies, immunotherapy depends on autologous immunity to kill tumor cells and tissues by activating or enhancing the body's immune system. Large numbers of recent studies suggest that low-frequency HIFU can not only enhance the intensity of the body's anti-cancer immune response, but also improve the efficiency of immunotherapy drug delivery to strengthen the effects of tumor immunotherapy. The focused ultrasound (FUS) destructs the tumor and simultaneously generates tumor debris and tumor-associated antigens, which enhances the immunogenicity of the tumor and stimulates the immune cells, inducing the body's immune response. Microbubbles are clinically used as a contrast. As a matter of fact, the addition of microbubbles can reinforce the destructive effect of FUS on the tumor and activate a stronger immune response. The combined application of ultrasound and microbubbles can more effectively open the blood brain barrier (BBB), which is beneficial to improving the intake of immune cells or immunotherapy drugs and exerting a positive influence in the lesion area. Currently, microbubbles and nanoparticles are commonly used as gene and drug carriers. Using ultrasound, the immune-related gene or antigen delivery itself can enhance the immune response and improve the efficacy of the immunotherapy.",2019-11,2022-08-17 14:54:58,2022-08-17 14:54:58,,714–728,4,16,,,eng,,,Number: 4 PMID: 31908890,,Review; FUS-BBBo,Blood-Brain Barrier Opening,,

FUS methods can non-invasively generate mechanical and/or thermal effects that capitalize on the unique oncogenomic/proteomic signature of a tumor. Potential benefits of FUS therapy for PDA include: (1) emulsification of targeted tumor into undenatured antigens in situ, increasing dendritic cell maturation, and increasing intra-tumoral CD8+/ T regulatory cell ratio and CD8+ T cell activity; (2) reduction in intra-tumoral hypoxic stress; (3) modulation of tumor cell membrane protein localization to enhance immunogenicity; (4) modulation of the local cytokine milieu toward a Th1-type inflammatory profile; (5) up-regulation of local chemoattractants; (6) remodeling the tumor stroma; (7) localized delivery of exogenously packaged immune-stimulating antigens, genes and therapeutic drugs. While not all of these results have been studied in experimental PDA models to date, the principles garnered from other solid tumor and disease models have direct relevance to the design of optimal FUS protocols for PDA. In this review, we address the pertinent limitations in current and emergent immune therapies that can be improved with FUS therapy for PDA.",2017-09,2022-08-17 14:54:58,2022-08-17 14:54:58,,1–14,,,,,eng,,,PMID: 28961038,,Primary; Histotripsy; Review; Mechanical; Pancreas; Drug delivery; PancreaticCancer; Adenocarcinoma; Pulsed-FUS; thermalablation; Immunomodulation; Thermal; PDA,Pulsed Focused Ultrasound,"Adenocarcinoma, Carcinoma",Carcinoma

This paper investigates a strategic method for precise lesion generation in which a low-frequency pump pulse is applied to enable a sub-threshold high-frequency probe pulse to exceed the intrinsic threshold.

A 20-element dual-frequency (500-kHz and 3-MHz elements confocally aligned) array transducer was used to generate dual-beam histotripsy pulses in red blood cell phantoms and porcine hepatic tissue specimens.

When the propagation direction of the probe pulse relative to the pump pulse was altered, the shape of the produced lesion changed based on the region that exceeded intrinsic threshold. Because the low-frequency pump pulse is more immune to attenuation and aberrations, and the high-frequency probe pulse can provide precision in lesion formation, this dual-beam histotripsy approach would be very useful in situations in which precise lesion formation is required through a highly attenuative and aberrative medium, such as transcranial therapy.

Patient immune function was monitored by determination of T-cell helper/suppressor (CD4/CD8) ratios immediately before and approximately 1 week following hyperthermia treatment. All 5 patients had normal total T-cell counts as measured by the pan-T-cell marker CD3. Two patients were noted to have inverted CD4/CD8 ratios (\textless 1:1) before hyperthermia. In both these cases, the ratio reverted to normal (\textgreater 1:1) 1 week following treatment. One patient whose CD4/CD8 ratio was not inverted was noted to have a further increase in his CD4 T cells relative to his CD8 (37% increase).

Extensive pre-clinical and clinical studies have evidenced that, in addition to direct destruction of the primary tumor, HIFU-thermoablation may elicit long-term systemic host anti-tumor immunity. In particular, an important consequence of HIFU treatment includes the release of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), the secretion of immuno-suppressing factors by cancer cells and the induction of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity. Radiation therapy (RT) is the main treatment modality used for many types of tumors and about 50% of all cancer patients receive RT, often used in combination with surgery and chemotherapy. It is well known that RT can modulate anti-tumor immune responses, modifying micro-environment and stimulating inflammatory factors that can greatly affect cell invasion, bystander effects, radiation tissue complications (such as fibrosis), genomic instability and thus, intrinsic cellular radio-sensitivity. To date, various combined therapeutic strategies (such as immuno-therapy) have been performed in order to enhance RT success in treating locally advanced and recurrent tumors. Recent works suggested the combined use of HIFU and RT treatments to increase the tumor cell radio-sensitivity, in order to synergize the effects reaching the maximum results with minimal doses of ionizing radiation (IR). Here, we highlight the opposite immuno-modulation roles of RT and HIFU, providing scientific reasons to test, by experimental approaches, the use of HIFU immune-stimulatory capacity to improve tumor radio-sensitivity, to reduce the RT induced inflammatory response and to decrease the dose-correlated side effects in normal tissues.",2017-02,2021-06-04 19:04:41,2021-06-04 19:04:41,,398–411,2,43,,,eng,,,Number: 2 PMID: 27780661,,Review; HIFU; RT,High Intensity Focused Ultrasound,,

FUS targeting to tumors has been shown to initiate pro-inflammatory immune responses within the tumor microenvironment. Pulsed FUS (pFUS) can alter the expression of cytokines, chemokines, trophic factors, cell adhesion molecules, and immune cell phenotypes within tissues. Here, we investigated the molecular and immune cell effects of pFUS on murine B16 melanoma and 4T1 breast cancer flank tumors. Temporal changes following sonication were evaluated by proteomics, RNA-seq, flow-cytometry, and histological analyses. Proteomic profiling revealed molecular changes occurring over 24 h post-pFUS that were consistent with a shift toward inflamed tumor microenvironment. Over 5 days post-pFUS, tumor growth rates were significantly decreased while flow cytometric analysis revealed differences in the temporal migration of immune cells. Transcriptomic analyses following sonication identified differences in gene expression patterns between the two tumor types. Histological analyses further demonstrated reduction of proliferation marker, Ki-67 in 4T1, but not in B16 tumors, and activated cleaved-caspase 3 for apoptosis remained elevated up to 3 days post-pFUS in both tumor types.

We developed an ultrasound-based mechanogenetics system to achieve this goal. Cells were engineered with the mechanosensor Piezo1 and genetic transducing modules to perceive the mechanical perturbation generated by the ultrasound wave and transduce it into genetic activities. Mechanosensitive and ultrasound-controllable T cells were further engineered to target and eradicate tumor cells with inducible chimeric antigen receptors. This mechanogenetics approach can be extended to remotely control, in principle, any gene activity in live cells for the reprogramming of cellular functions. This method should also provide a general approach to remotely control molecular functions for biological studies and clinical applications, particularly cell-based cancer immunotherapy.           ,              While cell-based immunotherapy, especially chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-expressing T cells, is becoming a paradigm-shifting therapeutic approach for cancer treatment, there is a lack of general methods to remotely and noninvasively regulate genetics in live mammalian cells and animals for cancer immunotherapy within confined local tissue space. To address this limitation, we have identified a mechanically sensitive Piezo1 ion channel (mechanosensor) that is activatable by ultrasound stimulation and integrated it with engineered genetic circuits (genetic transducer) in live HEK293T cells to convert the ultrasound-activated Piezo1 into transcriptional activities. We have further engineered the Jurkat T-cell line and primary T cells (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) to remotely sense the ultrasound wave and transduce it into transcriptional activation for the CAR expression to recognize and eradicate target tumor cells.

A potential solution to late and distant recurrence is to augment systemic antitumor immunity, in part by appropriately presenting tumor antigens, but also by modulating the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). We previously validated this concept in models of murine carcinoma treated with a novel predominately microcavitating version of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), mechanical high-intensity focused ultrasound (M-HIFU). Here we elucidated the mechanisms of enhanced antitumor immunity by M-HIFU over conventional thermal high-intensity focused ultrasound (T-HIFU) and investigated the potential of the combinatorial strategy with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, anti-PD-L1 antibody.                                         Methods               The antitumor efficacy of treatments was investigated in syngeneic murine breast cancer models using triple-negative (E0771) or human ErbB-2 (HER2) expressing (MM3MG-HER2) tumors in C57BL/6 or BALB/c mice, respectively. Induction of systemic antitumor immunity by the treatments was tested using bilateral tumor implantation models. Flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and single-cell RNA sequencing were performed to elucidate detailed effects of HIFU treatments or combination treatment on TME, including the activation status of CD8 T cells and polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs).                                         Results                                More potent systemic antitumor immunity and tumor growth suppression were induced by M-HIFU compared with T-HIFU. Molecular characterization of the TME after M-HIFU by single-cell RNA sequencing demonstrated repolarization of TAM to the immunostimulatory M1 subtype compared with TME post-T-HIFU. Concurrent anti-PD-L1 antibody administration or depletion of CD4                 +                 T cells containing a population of regulatory T cells markedly increased T cell-mediated antitumor immunity and tumor growth suppression at distant, untreated tumor sites in M-HIFU treated mice compared with M-HIFU monotherapy.

Conclusions               Physical disruption of the TME by M-HIFU repolarizes TAM, enhances T-cell infiltration, and, when combined with anti-PD-L1 antibody, mediates superior systemic antitumor immune responses and distant tumor growth suppression.

EAE reflects important histopathological hallmarks, dissemination, and diversity of the disease, but has only moderate reproducibility of clinical and histopathological features. Focal lesions are less frequently observed in EAE than in MS, and can neither be constrained to specific locations nor timed to occur at a pre-specified moment. This renders difficult any experimental assessment of the pathogenesis of lesion evolution, including its inflammatory, degenerative (demyelination and axonal degeneration), and reparatory (remyelination, axonal sprouting, gliosis) component processes. We sought to develop a controlled model of inflammatory, focal brain lesions in EAE using focused ultrasound (FUS). We hypothesized that FUS induced focal blood brain barrier disruption (BBBD) will increase the likelihood of transmigration of effector cells and subsequent lesion occurrence at the sonicated location. Lesion development was monitored with conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as with magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) and further analyzed by histopathological means. EAE was induced in 12 6–8 weeks old female C57BL/6 mice using myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) peptide. FUS-induced BBBD was performed 6, 7, and 9 days after immunization in subgroups of four animals and in an additional control group. MRI and MRE were performed on a 7T horizontal bore small animal MRI scanner. Imaging was conducted longitudinally 2 and 3 weeks after disease induction and 1 week after sonication in control animals, respectively. The scan protocol comprised contrast-enhanced T1-weighted and T2-weighted sequences as well as MRE with a vibration frequency of 1 kHz. Animals were sacrificed for histopathology after the last imaging time point. The overall clinical course of EAE was mild. A total of seven EAE animals presented with focal T2w hyperintense signal alterations in the sonicated hemisphere. These were most frequent in the group of animals sonicated 9 days after immunization. Histopathology revealed foci of activated microglia/macrophages in the sonicated right hemisphere of seven EAE animals. Larger cellular infiltrates or apparent demyelination were not seen. Control animals showed no abnormalities on MRI and did not have clusters of activated microglia/macrophages at the sites targeted with FUS. None of the animals had hemorrhages or gross tissue damage as potential side effects of FUS. EAE-animals tended to have lower values of viscoelasticity and elasticity in the sonicated compared to the contralateral parenchyma. This trend was significant when comparing the right sonicated to the left normal hemisphere and specifically the right sonicated compared to the left normal cortex in animals that underwent FUS-BBBD 9 days after immunization (right vs. left hemisphere: mean viscoelasticity 6.1 vs. 7.2 kPa;               p               = 0.003 and mean elasticity 4.9 vs. 5.7 kPa,               p               = 0.024; right vs. left cortex: mean viscoelasticity 5.8 vs. 7.5 kPa;               p               = 0.004 and mean elasticity 5 vs. 6.5 kPa;               p               = 0.008). A direct comparison of the biomechanical properties of focal T2w hyperintensities with normal appearing brain tissue did not yield significant results. Control animals showed no differences in viscoelasticity between sonicated and contralateral brain parenchyma. We here provide first evidence for a controlled lesion induction model in EAE using FUS-induced BBBD. The observed lesions in EAE are consistent with foci of activated microglia that may be interpreted as targeted initial inflammatory activity and which have been described as pre-active lesions in MS. Such foci can be identified and monitored with MRI.

Moreover, the increased inflammatory activity in the sonicated brain parenchyma seems to have an effect on overall tissue matrix structure as reflected by changes of biomechanical parameters.",2021-05-12,2022-08-17 18:46:27,2022-08-30 19:47:58,2022-08-17 18:46:27,665722,,15,Front.

N1-S1 HCC tumors were generated in the livers of immunocompetent rats (                                n                 =                 6                              , control;                                n                 =                 15                              , treatment). Real-time ultrasound-guided histotripsy was applied to ablate either                                100                 %                                   tumor                                   volume                 +                 up                                   to                                   2                                   mm                                   margin                              (                                n                 =                 9                              , complete treatment) or 50-75% tumor volume (                                n                 =                 6                              , partial treatment) by delivering 1-2 cycle histotripsy pulses at 100 Hz PRF (pulse repetition frequency) with                                p                 −                 ≥                 30                               MPa using a custom 1 MHz transducer. Rats were monitored weekly using MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) for 3 months or until tumors reached ~25 mm.               Results               . MRI revealed effective post-histotripsy reduction of tumor burden with near-complete resorption of the ablated tumor in 14/15 (93.3%) treated rats. Histopathology showed <5 mm shrunken, non-tumoral, fibrous tissue at the treatment site at 3 months. Rats with increased tumor burden (3/6 control and 1 partial treatment) were euthanized early by 2-4 weeks. In 3 other controls, histology revealed fibrous tissue at original tumor site at 3 months. There was no evidence of histotripsy-induced off-target tissue injury.               Conclusion               . Complete and partial histotripsy ablation resulted in effective tumor removal for 14/15 rats, with no evidence of local tumor progression or recurrence.",2020-11-25,2022-08-19 19:12:30,2022-08-30 15:50:40,2022-08-19 19:12:30,1-14,,2020,BME Frontiers,,en,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,PreClinical; ResearchArticle; Liver; Histology; Histotripsy; HepatocellularCarcinoma; FUS-alone; H&E; PrimaryTumor; Orthotopic; Mestastases; N1-S1,Histotripsy,Carcinoma,Carcinoma

METHODS: Ninety six cases with primary liver cancer patients, consisting of 66 males and 30 females, were enrolled in this study and treated with high intensity focused ultrasound combined with stereotactic segmentation dose radiation, low frequency for 10 times, followed by analysis of KPS score of liver cancer, Child-Pugh, grading and staging of liver cancer, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year of clinical symptom remission rate, tumor markers, liver function, survival rate, as well as the change of immune related cytokines. RESULTS: Three months after high intensity focused ultrasound treatment, abdominal distension abdominal pain, jaundice symptoms, anorexia and ascites were significantly relieved compared with before treatment (P\textless 0.05). At 3 months after treatment, levels of AFP and CA199 were significantly reduced than before treatment (P\textless 0.05). Meanwhile, Child-Pugh classification score was significantly decreased at 3 months after treatment compared with before treatment, which was further decreased at 6 months after treatment than 3 months after treatment (P\textless 0.05). In addition, ALT, AST, AKP, propagated and TBIL level at 3 months after treatment displayed no differences to those before treatment but was significantly decreased at 6 months treatment (P\textless 0.05). Moreover, the late stages of liver cancer, the lower survival rate after treatment. Furthermore, the levels of NK, CD3, CD4, CD8 and CD4/CD8 cytokines were significantly increased at 3 months after treatment (P\textless 0.05), together with significantly increased levels of IFN-r and IL-2 and decreased levels of IL-4 and IL-10 (P\textless 0.05).

METHODS: Twenty C57BL/6J mice bearing H22 hepatocellular carcinoma were used to generate antitumor vaccines. Ten mice underwent HIFU ablation, and the remaining 10 mice received a sham-HIFU procedure with no ultrasound irradiation. Sixty normal mice were randomly divided into HIFU vaccine, tumor vaccine and control groups. These mice were immunized with HIFU-generated vaccine, tumor-generated vaccine, and saline, respectively. In addition, 20 mice bearing H22 tumors were successfully treated with HIFU ablation. The protective immunity of the vaccinated mice was investigated before and after a subsequent H22 tumor challenge. Using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, the cytotoxicity of splenic lymphocytes co-cultured with H22 cells was determined in vitro before the tumor challenge, and tumor volume and survival were measured in vivo after the challenge in each group. The mechanism was also explored by loading the vaccines with bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs). RESULTS: Compared to the control, HIFU therapy, tumor-generated and HIFU-generated vaccines significantly increased cytolytic activity against H22 cells in the splenocytes of the vaccinated mice (P \textless 0.001). The tumor volume was significantly smaller in the HIFU vaccine group than in the tumor vaccine group (P \textless 0.05) and control group (P \textless 0.01).
